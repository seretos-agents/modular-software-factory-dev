"""The one choke point through which every ``gh`` CLI invocation in this
package must pass (see ``ci/__init__.py``'s discipline note and
``tests/test_ci_gh_discipline.py``).

``run_gh`` resolves ``gh`` via ``shutil.which`` (never lets a raw
``FileNotFoundError`` leak out when it's missing from ``PATH``) and never
invokes a shell to run it (no shell-invoking subprocess flag, no
os-module system-execution call). JSON responses are always parsed in
Python: no gh-side query-filter, quiet-JSON, templating, or automatic-
pagination flag is ever passed to ``gh`` -- ``gh_paginate_rest`` implements
REST pagination itself, one explicit page-numbered request at a time.
